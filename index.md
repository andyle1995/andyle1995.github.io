# about this site

This website is an unofficial quick reference guide to United States copyright law and fair use applications. It was created for TXTDS 503, a course about 20th century book publishing history, at the University of Washington.

This guide aims to inform humanities and information science scholars on the fair use of copyrighted material in the United States. In particular, this guide focuses on fair uses of physical material (e.g. books, poems, photographs, etc.) in order to avoid the murkier waters of born digital documents and fair use under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

This guide covers a brief history of U.S.C Title 17, the implementation of the four factors of fair use and relevent decisions that shaped their interpretation today, and common "copyright myths" that permeate pop culture and academia alike. This guide **is not** comprehensive and should be used as a starting point of intellectual property research.

**DISCLAIMER:**

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
