# <a name="about"></a>about this site

This website is an unofficial quick reference guide to United States copyright law and fair use applications. It was created for [TXTDS 503](https://frenchitalian.washington.edu/courses/2023/spring/txtds/503/a), a course about 20th century book publishing history, at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

This guide aims to inform humanities and information science scholars on the fair use of copyrighted material in the United States. In particular, this guide focuses on fair uses of physical material (e.g. books, poems, photographs, etc.) in order to avoid the murkier waters of born digital documents and fair use under the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf).

The sections of this site cover a brief history of [Title 17](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/html/USCODE-2011-title17.htm), the four factors of fair use and their implementation, relevant decisions that shaped their interpretation today, and common “copyright myths” that permeate pop culture and academia alike. This guide is not comprehensive and should be used only as a starting point for intellectual property research.

# <a name="copyright"></a>what is copyright?

In the United States, federal copyright law is codified under [Title 17](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title17/html/USCODE-2011-title17.htm) out 54 total titles. According to the [United States Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/)
> Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression.

Copyright has two basic ingredients: originality and fixation.

Originality is a particular expression of a “spark” of creativity [created by a human](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-naruto-v-slater). Works that constitute originality may include novels, poems, paintings, blogs, comics, etc. Previous court cases did not afford copyright protection to some works on the basis that they are not creative, for example [lists of ingredients](https://copyrightalliance.org/are-recipes-cookbooks-protected-by-copyright/), [fonts](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-37/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-202/section-202.1), or [facsimile](https://ebrary.net/4214/law/facsimile_copies_public_domain_works_still_copyright).

Fixation is the permanence of the work. The medium that carries the original expression must be sufficiently permanent to gain copyright protections. A painting is sufficiently permanent because the expression is fixed to the canvas. Alternatively, [a garden is not sufficiently permanent](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-kelley-v-chi-park-dist) because the expression changes with the growth or decay of the plants. Recent cases have reenergized legal theories surrounding fixation.

[Works in the public domain](https://www.feedbooks.com/catalog/public_domain) are not copyrighted and may be used by any one for any purpose. The public domain includes works created by federal, state, and local governments, works that have surpassed their copyright terms, and works made public by their creators. Some works under creative commons licenses are not in the public domain, however their creators permit anyone to use them as they would public domain works.

### copyrights

Copyrights are the rights afforded to the holder of copyright. For example, the artist of an original painting has the right to sell reproductions for profits. Copyrights are often thought of as an economic benefit of creativity, however the rights pertain to the intellectual content of the work, not necessarily the financial draw.

Copyrighted material is sometimes [licensed](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-is-a-copyright-license) to users in exchange for a fee. The copyright holder retains the ownership of the material, but the licensee is able to use the work in limited instances.

### copyright terms

Current copyright terms vary widely depending on when and where the work was created. All works published before 1928 are now in the public domain. For works published after 1978, the copyright term is 70 years plus the life of the creator. [Cornell's guide](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain) features a helpful copyright term chart.

# <a name="fairuse"></a>fair use

Everyone creates and uses copyrighted material. In order to use someone else's copyrighted material without infringing on their rights, in other word fairly, we must play by the rules. [Harvard Law](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use#:~:text=Fair%20use%20is%20the%20right,law%20is%20designed%20to%20foster.) explains
> Fair use is the right to use a copyrighted work under certain conditions without permission of the copyright owner.

But what are the "certian conditions"?

U.S.C. Title 17 § 107 explicitly limits exclusive restrictions on copyrights by listing four elements of permitted uses. These are most commonly referred to as the four factors of fair use. They are:

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
2. the nature of the copyrighted work
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

[§108](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108) further limits exclusive restrictions on copyrights by granting specific exemptions to non-profit libraries, archives, and educational institutions. This is not a loophole however. Non-profit educational institutions must still reach fair use determinations for their uses of copyrighted material.

### the purpose and character of use

A user’s intention is an important consideration in fair use. Although the character of use is a fact-specific factor, general purposes include commercial, personal, educational, or transformative. Past decisions have favored personal and educational uses as fair, while commercial uses are more commonly infringing. Transformative use justifications are highly interpretative and expanded in the 1990s. Judge Pierre Leval's essay ["Toward A Fair Use Standard"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1341457) is widely considered a foundational text on transformative work.

A 2023 supreme court case radically altered previous interpretations of this factor. In [_Andy Warhol Foundation For the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith et al._](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-869_87ad.pdf) the supreme court's 7-2 decision determined that a change in medium - in this case photography to painting - was not transformative. This is a major deparature from previous interpretations of transformation, for example [_Authors Guild v. Google_](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4829/13-4829-2015-10-16.html).

### the nature of the copyrighted work

Fair use also considers the kind of work and its content. The work may be creative, fact-based, or derived from sources in the public domain. Factual or public domain sources generally favors fair use, while use of creative works leans towards infringement. Another component of this factor is the work's publication status. Unpublished works are still protected by copyright if they are original and fixed, however court's have emphasized authorial control over intellectual property regardless of formality. 

In [_Salinger v. Random House, Inc._](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-salinger-v-random-house-inc) the supreme court determined Salinger's unpublished correspondence was protected by copyright, thereby establishing precedence for protections on unpublished personl works. Salinger effectively prevented a biographer from illicitly using this correspondence as a basis for a book.

### the amount and substantiality of the work used

This factor weighs the amount of the material used against the whole. However, the factor considers both _quantity_ and _quality_ of use. The amount used is equally important as the significance of the portion used. Some users erroneously believe that using a small portion of a work automatically constitutes fair use, while using the entirety is not. On the contrary, previous decisions have determined use of as little as 1% of the whole is infringing, while others ruled using an entire work is fair. Courts may compare the content and extent used to the rest of the work.

It is worth noting that some uses necessarily incorporate the entire work. Photographs, for example, rarely appear in part. Conversely, using the entirety of a novel may weigh heavily against fair use.

[_Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises_](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/539) dispells the myth about quantity over quality in fair use. _The Nation_ magazine published excerpts from President Gerald Ford's memoir _A Time To Heal_ totaling less than 1% of the entire work. However, the portion used - concerning President Ford's pardon of President Nixon - was considered the "heart" of the book. The supreme court ruled that regardless of the quantity used, the subsantiality warranted infringement.

### the effect of use on the market

Every use carries some economic effect on the material. Fair use determinations require a general estimation of this impact, no matter how small. Although courts do not rely on estimated dollar amount for each use, they frequently recognize rough estimates of economic significance. Individual personal use may be considered a very small effect, while facsimile reproductions or “bootlegs” may overridge the market altogether. Generally, smaller effects favor fair use.

Although the National Football League suggests otherwise, recording a televised football game has been ruled protected fair use. Selling the copy would likely constitute infringemet, however, due to the effect on the market for sports entertainment. [In 2016 a man discovered a VHS copy of Super Bowl I, which was not permanently recorded, in his attic](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/sports/football/super-bowl-i-recording-broadcast-nfl-troy-haupt.html). Although he owns the recording, he does not own the rights to the content, thus the only legal buyer would be the NFL. The NFL sent a cease and desist reminding him that, although they do not want to buy it, he cannot sell it to any other party without risking legal action.

# <a name="fairusedetermination"></a>making a fair use determination

Unlike other practices of law, in making a fair use determination users are tasked with evaluating their uses in the same method of the courts. Users must make a “good faith” determination using the four factors of fair use and, for academic or business purposes, document this decision making process.

Fair use determinations are fact intensive: there is no fool-proof test, standard, or formula. A user, like a court, must reach a conclusion given the variables at hand. Courts may also make determinations given previous decisions from similar cases. If possible, academic or business users should consult with legal counsel or law librarians for more information.

# <a name="mythsofcopyright"></a>common myths of copyright

### ideas are copyrightable

**Myth:** "I am owed compensation by the person using an idea I had."

A common misconception is that simply because we had an idea (a refigerator design, the plot of a good movie, a great salsa recipe) it is protected by copyright.

**False:** although ideas are a form of intellectual property, copyrighted material must be original and fixed. Ideas are not a fixed medium, and therefore cannot be copyrighted. [Regardless, many people still try](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/copyright-product-license-17856.html). Ideas are unprotected by copyright, but they may be possible to protect as a [trade secret](https://www.wipo.int/tradesecrets/en/) provided they are commercially valuable.

### the 30 second sample rule

**Myth:** "I can copy up to 30 seconds of a song before it is infrignment" _or_ "I can quote up to 200 words from a book before it is infringement."

The 30 second sample rule originated in the hip hop and electronic music scenes. This urban legend is also known as a the 200 word rule, the 2 minute rule, or the 1% rule. Regardless of its name, the idea is the same: using a very small amount of a work automatically qualifies as fair use.

**False:** there is no "amount" of use that automatically qualifies it as fair. Courts frequently rule in favor of uses that use small amounts or as little as possible, however it is not a hard rule. As we see in [_Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises_](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use#:~:text=Fair%20use%20is%20the%20right,law%20is%20designed%20to%20foster.), even uses totaling less than 1% of the entire work may still constitute infringment. This myth is likely the most pervasive, even appearing on [Wikipedia's style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Music_samples#:~:text=maximum%20length%20permitted%3F-,Guidelines,reduced%20quality%20from%20the%20original.) and a [university's copyright guidelines page](https://lasierra.edu/library/copyright-fair-use-guidelines/).

### any academic use is fair use

**Myth:** "I can copy this sheet music as many times as I want as long as I only use it for my class."

Some education professionals have taken the "education exempetion" to heart and believe any use for learning is fair.

**False:**

### altering a work is inherently transformative

**Myth:** "If I alter my friend's assignment just enough, it isn't plagarism."

This belief extends transformation in two ways: both as an easy threshold to overcome and as automatic fair use. A more _nuanced_ approach may consider artistic parody a "get out of jail free card" for fair use.

**False:** Some interpretations of transformation in the first factor of fair use gave it the widest reach of fair use. However, alhough courts recognize fair use in these instances more, transformation is not a requisite for fair use. Even instances of genuine transformation may be infringing. In [_Warner Bros. v. RDR Books_](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/2007), the courts found that an online encylopedia's substantial additions and alterations to J.K. Rowling's _Harry Potter_ series did constitute transformation. However, the substantial unaltered excerpts from the books were still infringing.

### undefended copyright is forfeited

**Myth:** "if I use someone's copyrighted material and they don't stop me, it's fair use."

Sometimes this is scalled the "rigorous defense" of copyright or trademarks. Some erroneously believe the letter of the law forces copyright or trademark holders to rigorously defend their rights lest they be lost.

**False:** Although trademarks have a [three year abandonment clause](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/reviving-abandoned-application), both copyrights and trademarks are active until the end of term [unless the holder explicity forfeits them](https://copyright.uslegal.com/2017/05/09/losswaiver-of-copyright-infringement-rights/). Generally it is a good idea for companies to police infringing uses of their material if they intend to market it, however it is not requisite for retaining legal intellectual control.
