# about this site

This website is an unofficial quick reference guide to United States copyright law and fair use applications. It was created for TXTDS 503, a course about 20th century book publishing history, at the University of Washington.

This guide aims to inform humanities and information science scholars on the fair use of copyrighted material in the United States. In particular, this guide focuses on fair uses of physical material (e.g. books, poems, photographs, etc.) in order to avoid the murkier waters of born digital documents and fair use under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

The sections of this guide cover a brief history of U.S.C Title 17, the four factors of fair use and their implementation, relevant decisions that shaped their interpretation today, and common “copyright myths” that permeate pop culture and academia alike. This guide is not comprehensive and should be used as a starting point for intellectual property research.

# what is copyright?

According to the United States Copyright Office
> Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression.

Copyright has two basic ingredients: originality and fixation.

Originality is a particular expression of a “spark” of creativity [created by a human](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-naruto-v-slater). Works that constitute originality may include novels, poems, paintings, blogs, comics, etc. Previous court cases did not afford copyright protection to some works on the basis that they are not creative, for example lists of ingredients, fonts, or facsimiles.

Fixation is the permanence of the work. The medium that carries the original expression must be sufficiently permanent to gain copyright protections. A painting is sufficiently permanent because the expression is fixed to the canvas. Alternatively, a garden is not sufficiently permanent because the expression changes with the growth or decay of the plants. Recent cases have reenergized legal theories surrounding fixation.

Works in the public domain are not copyrighted and may be used by any one for any purpose. The public domain includes works created by federal, state, and local governments, works that have surpassed their copyright terms, and works made public by their creators. Some works under creative commons licenses are not in the public domain, however their creators permit anyone to use them as they would public domain works.

### copyrights

Copyrights are the rights afforded to the holder of copyright. For example, the artist of an original painting has the right to sell reproduction for profits. Copyrights are often thought of as an economic benefit of creativity, however the rights pertain to the intellectual content of the work, not necessarily the financial draw.

Copyrighted material is sometimes licensed to users in exchange for a fee. The copyright holder retains the ownership of the material, but the licensee is able to use the work in limited instances.

### copyright terms

Current copyright terms vary widely depending on when and where the work was created. All works published before 1928 are now in the public domain. For works published after 1978, the copyright term is 70 years plus the life of the creator. [Cornell's guide](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain) features a helpful copyright term chart.

### a brief history of U.S.C. Title 17

# fair use

Everyone creates and uses copyrighted material. In order to use 

U.S.C. Title 17 § 107 explicitly limits exclusive restrictions on copyrights by listing four elements of permitted uses. These are mostly commonly referred to as the four factors of fair use. They are:

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
2. the nature of the copyrighted work
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

### the purpose and character of use

A user’s intention is an important consideration in fair use. Although the character of use is a fact-specific variable, general purposes include commercial, personal, or educational. This factor also encompasses transformative uses.

### the nature of the copyrighted work

Fair use also considers the kind of work and its content. The work may be creative, fact-based, or derived from sources in the public domain. Factual or public domain sources generally favors fair use, while use of creative works leans towards infringement.

### the amount and substantiality of the worked used

This factor weighs the amount of the material used against the whole. However, the factor is about both quantity and quality of use. The amount used is equally important as the significance of the portion used. A common misconception is that using a small portion of a work is automatically fair use, while using the entirety is not. On the contrary, previous decisions have determined uses as little as 1% of the whole are infringing, while others ruled using an entire work is fair. Courts may compare the content and extent used to the rest of the work.

It is worth noting that some uses necessarily incorporate the entire work. Photographs, for example, are rarely dissected. Conversely, using the entirety of a novel may weigh heavily against fair use.

### the effect of use on the market

Every use carries some economic effect on the material. Fair use determinations require a general estimation of this impact, no matter how small. Although courts do not expect an estimated dollar amount on each use, they may expect some recognition of the economic significance. Individual personal use may be considered a very small effect, while facsimile reproductions or “bootlegs” may override the market altogether. Generally, generally smaller effects favor fair use.

# making a fair use deteremination

Unlike other practices of law, in making a fair use determination users are tasked with evaluating their uses in the same method of the courts. Users must make a “good faith” determination using the four factors of fair use and, for academic or business purposes, document this decision making process.

Fair use determinations are fact intensive: there is no fool-proof test, standard, or formula. A user, like a court, must reach a conclusion given the variables at hand. Courts may also make determinations given previous decisions from similar cases. If possible, academic or business users should consult with legal counsel or law librarians for more information.
